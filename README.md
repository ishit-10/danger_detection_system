# danger_detection_system
A Real-time computer vision prototype that detects a red-colored object (representing a user’s hand) and monitors its proximity to a defined virtual danger zone on screen. Using OpenCV, the system continuously tracks the object and triggers visual warnings when it approaches or enters the unsafe boundary. If the hand reaches dangerously close, a bold on-screen alert displays: “DANGER DANGER”.
It can be used for testing interaction safety concepts in robotics, automation, and AR/VR environments.
